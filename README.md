# User-Operation-State-Model-Generator

This is a sample of the tool we create to generate state models of user operations. 
You can just click the User_Operation_State_Model_Generator.exe to start the tool. 
In this sample, we use the espresso log file as an example. When you execute the exe file, please make sure the two files are in the same directory.
